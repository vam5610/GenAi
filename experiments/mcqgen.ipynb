Generative AI offers enormous productivity benefits for individuals and organizations, and while it also presents very real challenges and risks, businesses are forging ahead, exploring how the technology can improve their internal workflows and enrich their products and services. According to research by the management consulting firm McKinsey, one third of organizations are already using generative AI regularly in at least one business function.Â¹ Industry analyst Gartner projects more than 80% of organizations will have deployed generative AI applications or used generative AI application programming interfaces (APIs) by 2026.2\\n\\nTraining\\nGenerative AI begins with a foundation modelâ€”a deep learning model that serves as the basis for multiple different types of generative AI applications. The most common foundation models today are large language models (LLMs), created for text generation applications, but there are also foundation models for image generation, video generation, and sound and music generationâ€”as well as multimodal foundation models that can support several kinds content generation.\\n\", 'number': (3,), 'subject': ('AI',), 'tone': ('Simple',), 'RESPONSE_JSON': '{\"1\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"2\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"3\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}}', 'quiz': '\\n{\\n    \"1\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"What type of machine learning models does generative AI rely on?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Supervised learning models\",\\n            \"b\": \"Deep learning models\",\\n            \"c\": \"Reinforcement learning models\",\\n            \"d\": \"Unsupervised learning models\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"b\"\\n    },\\n    \"2\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"According to McKinsey research, what percentage of organizations are already using generative AI regularly in at least one business function?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"10%\",\\n            \"b\": \"50%\",\\n            \"c\": \"33%\",\\n            \"d\": \"75%\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"c\"\\n    },\\n    \"3\": {\\n        \"mcq\": \"What are the most common foundation models used in generative AI applications today?\",\\n        \"options\": {\\n            \"a\": \"Image models\",\\n            \"b\": \"Large language models (LLMs)\",\\n            \"c\": \"Reinforcement learning models\",\\n            \"d\": \"Supervised learning models\"\\n        },\\n        \"correct\": \"b\"\\n    }\\n}', 'review': 'The complexity of the quiz is high as it requires knowledge of machine learning terminology and research statistics.
